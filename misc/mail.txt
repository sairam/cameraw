You've got some interesting ideas going for your site.  Here's my
high-level advice:

- start small
- release something early and get feedback from users
- expand based on what your users tell you

In your case I think the most unique feature idea is the one where
users can show off what gear they have.  That also leads into your
idea for setting up loans and trades of gear.  So anything required to
get that feature working would be a priority.  i.e.

- users (login/password management, etc.  Perhaps integrate with
Facebook or Twitter or whatever is popular in India)
- product list: I'd keep it really simple; product name, type (camera,
lens, flash, etc.) and a picture maybe, add deeper specs later
- a way for users to select what gear they have
- a page for each user that displays their gear
- a way for users to comment on gear or ask questions about it (maybe
use a 3rd party commenting system like disqus.com)
- a way for users to find other users that are close to them so they
can look at their gear, request loans etc.          (pending)

You want the minimum thing you can build that provides some value to
users.  The first bit of value would be they are able to show off
their gear.  If you start to get users, the next thing might be a
system to track gear loans between users.  That will start to give you
some data that could be used to to determine what users are
trustworthy.

There's not much opportunity for revenue at this point, but if you
start to build a user base you'll know you're on to something and can
start to work on revenue generating ideas.

Hope these ideas help.
